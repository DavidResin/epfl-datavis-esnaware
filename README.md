## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This project comes from a joint idea by several members of ESN Lausanne. We wish to implement a platform that allows users to have a global understanding of issues relating to climate change. We want to display information in a way that makes navigation through the issues easy and interactive. The idea would be to give them the ability to view basic data stories about each of them expliciting their causes, their actors, their consequences and the solutions being brought. One of the aims of this project is therefore to raise awereness in a different and novel way.

### Dataset
The dataset that we are going to use is mainly going to be based on articles from Wikipedia. They are selected from categories that are related to climate change and their ramifications. The choice of this dataset is crucial as Wikipedia is now the most complete and grounded source of knowledge and therefore is the best place to look for information about different global issues.

The dataset has to be scraped from Wikipedia and then several NLP methods have to be applied to get all the information we need. However, as we are only looking at a subgraph of the graph of articles related to climate change, these operations will not be too demanding.

### Problematic
The inability to have a broad understanding of interconnected global issues hinders our collective ability to tackle them. This typically applies to climate change. One of our team members had this notable experience with their family. Indeed, their family did not know about the relationship between the food on our plates and global warming. This instigated a whole conversation about how to get information about climate change and the lack of broad view of the issue. This particular episode led to discussions between our team members and this spawned our project idea.

As previously mentioned, the aim of the project is to implement a platform that allows easy navigation through the interconnected, underlying issues of climate change and easy access to interactive information about the different issues. This project is intended for any person who is curious to know more about the topic and for people who have difficulties linking the dots and grasping the whole picture.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
We are going to use a subset of the dataset. It comprises hundreds of articles extracted from Wikipedia based on several hand-selected issues that we want to address through this project. 

The ultimate goal would be a platform presenting content contributed both by human and machine, with the machine providing the linkage between concepts while humans will collectively "fill in the blanks" in the vein of Wikipedia. Therefore we will present our work in the shape of a "proof-of-concept" with several entries in our dataset handcrafted just like they would in the final design. Here are a few examples of how that would be presented :

Please note that these are by no means complete data stories but just ideas of what we would find relevant to present.

- Cobalt (resource)
  - Uses : Alloys (22 %), Batteries (22 %)
  - Origins : Nickel mining (non-renewable)
  - Main locations : DR Congo (63 %)
  - Consequences : Wars, shortage due to rise in electric car needs
  - Solutions : Batteries requiring less/no cobalt (in development)
- Rising sea levels (climatic phenomenon)
  - Causes : Polar ice caps melting
  - Main locations : worldwide oceans
  - Consequences : Flooding of human and natural areas, population displacement
  - Passive solutions : Dams , Seawalls
  - Active solutions : Mitigation of global warming, Refreezing
- Helium (resource)
  - Uses : Cryogenics (Space industry, MRIs), Controlled atmospheres, Pressurizing, Welding, Balloons (minor but well-known)
  - Origins : Underground pockets of natural gas (non-renewable), Nuclear fusion (renewable but impossible on a large scale)$
  - Main locations : USA (55 %), Qatar (32 %)
  - Consequences : Shortage due to evaporation, increased price for valuable processes
  - Solutions : Conservation efforts, limitation of "wasteful" uses
- Cars (transportation)
  - Causes : Social necessity to move great distances for work and leisure, Industry
  - Main locations : worldwide
  - Consequences : Air pollution, noise pollution, heavy precious resource consumption per individual
  - Solutions : Reduction of transportation needs, Public Transportation, Cleaner vehicles

### Related Work
We are in a way building upon a common practice of assembling graphs from Wikipedia page links. Many projects attempt to display interconnections between subjects that way, but we wish to bring a curative aspect to it with our project. Professor Hans Rösling's works were an influential factor as we liked his approach to data, with his intent to curate it in order to let people have an informed view of the world, seeing both the degradations and the improvements over time, which is something that can easily be lost in the "hot news"-style transmission of knowledge many people are used to.
