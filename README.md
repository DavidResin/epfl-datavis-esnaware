## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This project comes from a joint idea by several members of ESN Lausanne. We wish to implement a platform that allows users to have a global understanding of issues relating to climate change. The idea would be to give them the ability to view basic data stories about each of them expliciting their causes, their actors, their consequences and the solutions being brought.

### Dataset
Wikipedia categories.

### Problematic
The inability to have a broad understanding of interconnected global issues.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Show basic stats.

### Related Work
We are in a way building upon a common practice of assembling graphs from Wikipedia page links. Many projects attempt to display interconnections between subjects that way, but we wish to bring a curative aspect to it with our project

## Milestone 2 (Friday 1st May, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**




## Milestone 3 (Thursday 28th May, 5pm)

**80% of the final grade**
